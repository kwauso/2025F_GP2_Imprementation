# VCKnots

<p align="center">Pluggable framework for building Verifiable Credentials ecosystems.</p>

## Overview

VCKnots is an open-source library for building Verifiable Credentials ecosystems.
It implements OID4VCI (OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance) and OID4VP (OpenID for Verifiable Presentations), with core wallet functionalities for identifier and key management.

The framework supports pluggable extensions for data serialization formats, protocol flavors, and cryptographic algorithms.

**Key Features:**
- OID4VCI and OID4VP implementations
- Core wallet functionalities (identifier and key management)
- Pluggable architecture (extensible formats, protocols, and algorithms)
